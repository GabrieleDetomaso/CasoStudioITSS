&nbsp; * public members of the type as well. However, a member of such an annotated
&nbsp; * type is allowed to declare a {@link Status} of lower stability. For example,
&nbsp; * a class annotated with {@code @API(status = STABLE)} may declare a constructor
&nbsp; * for internal usage that is annotated with {@code @API(status = INTERNAL)}.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;If {@code @API} is present on a package, it is considered to hold for all
&nbsp; * public types in its package. The same rules for lowered stability apply as
&nbsp; * if they were specified on a type.
